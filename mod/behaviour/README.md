# PURPOSE
The behaviour module allows teachers to maintain a record of behaviour, replacing or supplementing a paper-based behaviour register.
It is primarily used in blended-learning environments where students are required to attend classes, lectures and tutorials and allows
the teacher to track and optionally provide a grade for the students behaviour.

Sessions can be configured to allow students to record their own behaviour and a range of different reports are available.
