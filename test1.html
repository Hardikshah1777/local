    <h2 id="head-2-159">What Is CompTIA A+ Certification?</h2>
    <p id="flast-para-0007" class="GLS-paragraph">The A+ certification program was developed by CompTIA to provide an industrywide means of certifying the competency of computer service technicians. The A+ certification is granted to those who have attained the level of knowledge and troubleshooting skills that are needed <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page-V2_xxvi" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="xxvi"></span>to provide capable support in the field of personal computers. It is similar to other certifications in the computer industry, such as the Cisco Certified Support Technician (CCST) program and the Microsoft certification programs. The theory behind these certifications is that if you need to have service performed on any of their products, you would sooner call a technician who has been certified in one of the appropriate certification programs than just call the first “expert” in the phone book.</p>
    <p class="GLS-paragraph">The A+ certification program was created to offer a wide-ranging certification, in the sense that it is intended to certify competence with personal computers and mobile devices from many different makers/vendors. You must pass two tests to become A+ certified:</p>
    <ul class="GLS-paragraph square" id="flast-list-0001">
        <li id="flast-li-0001">The Core 1 220-1201 exam, which covers basic computer concepts, PC hardware, basic networking, mobile devices, and hardware troubleshooting</li>
        <li id="flast-li-0002">The Core 2 220-1202 exam, which covers operating systems, security, software troubleshooting, and operational procedures</li>
    </ul>
    <p id="flast-para-0009" class="GLS-paragraph">You don't have to take the 220-1201 and the 220-1202 exams at the same time. However, the A+ certification is not awarded until you've passed both tests.</p>
    <section><span id="flast-sec-0003"></span>
        <h3 id="head-3-254">Why Become A+ Certified?</h3>
        <p class="GLS-paragraph">There are several good reasons to get your A+ certification. The CompTIA Candidate's Information packet lists five major benefits:</p>
        <ul class="GLS-paragraph square" id="flast-list-0002">
            <li id="flast-li-0003">It demonstrates proof of professional achievement.</li>
            <li id="flast-li-0004">It increases your marketability.</li>
            <li id="flast-li-0005">It provides greater opportunity for advancement in your field.</li>
            <li id="flast-li-0006">It is increasingly a requirement for some types of advanced training.</li>
            <li id="flast-li-0007">It raises customer confidence in you and your company's services.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="GLS-paragraph none" id="flast-list-0003">
            <li id="flast-li-0008"><b>Provides Proof of Professional Achievement </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The A+ certification is a status symbol in the computer service industry. Organizations that include members of the computer service industry recognize the benefits of A+ certification and push for their members to become certified. And more people every day are putting the “A+ Certified Technician” emblem on their business cards.</li>
            <li id="flast-li-0009"><b>Increases Your Marketability </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A+ certification makes individuals more marketable to potential employers. A+ certified employees also may receive a higher base salary because employers won't have to spend as much money on vendor-specific training.</li>
            <li id="flast-li-0010"><b>Provides Opportunity for Advancement </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most raises and advancements are based on performance. A+ certified employees work faster and more efficiently and are thus more productive. The more productive employees are, the more money they make for their company. And, of course, the more money they make for the company, the more valuable they are to the company. So, if an employee is A+ certified, their chances of being promoted are greater.</li>
            <li id="flast-li-0011"><b><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page-V2_xxvii" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="xxvii"></span>Fulfills Training Requirements </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most major computer hardware vendors recognize A+ certification. Some of these vendors apply A+ certification toward prerequisites in their own respective certification programs, which has the side benefit of reducing training costs for employers.</li>
            <li id="flast-li-0012"><b>Raises Customer Confidence </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the A+ Certified Technician moniker becomes better known among computer owners, more of them will realize that the A+ technician is more qualified to work on their computer equipment than a noncertified technician.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="head-3-255">How to Become A+ Certified</h3>
        <p class="GLS-paragraph">A+ certification is available to anyone who passes two exams. You don't have to work for any particular company. It's not a secret society. It is, however, an elite group. To become A+ certified, you must do two things:</p>
        <ul class="GLS-paragraph square" id="flast-list-0004">
            <li id="flast-li-0013">Pass the Core 1 220-1201 exam.</li>
            <li id="flast-li-0014">Pass the Core 2 220-1202 exam.</li>
        </ul>
        <p id="flast-para-0017" class="GLS-paragraph">The exams can be taken at any Pearson VUE testing center. If you pass both exams, you will get a certificate in the mail from CompTIA saying that you have passed, and you will also receive a lapel pin and business card.</p>
        <p id="flast-para-0018" class="GLS-paragraph">To register for the tests, go to <code><a href="http://www.pearsonvue.com/comptia">www.pearsonvue.com/comptia</a></code>. You'll be asked for your name, Social Security number (an optional number may be assigned if you don't wish to provide your Social Security number), mailing address, phone number, employer, when and where you want to take the test, and your credit card number. (Payment arrangements must be made at the time of registration.)</p>

        <h3 id="head-3-256">Tips for Taking the A+ Exam</h3>
        <p class="GLS-paragraph">Here are some general tips for taking your exam successfully:</p>
        <ul class="GLS-paragraph square" id="flast-list-0005">
            <li id="flast-li-0015">Bring two forms of ID with you. One must be a photo ID, such as a driver's license. The other can be a major credit card or a passport. Both forms must include a signature.</li>
            <li id="flast-li-0016">Arrive early at the exam center so that you can relax and review your study materials, particularly tables and lists of exam-related information. When you enter the testing room, you will need to leave everything outside; you won't be able to bring any materials into the testing area.</li>
            <li id="flast-li-0017">Read the questions carefully. Don't be tempted to jump to an early conclusion. Make sure that you know exactly what each question is asking.</li>
            <li id="flast-li-0018">Don't leave any unanswered questions. Unanswered questions are scored against you. Some questions will have multiple correct responses. When a question has more than one correct answer, a message at the bottom of the screen will prompt you to, for example, choose two. Be sure to read the messages displayed to know how many correct answers you must choose.</li>
            <li id="flast-li-0019"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page-V2_xxviii" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="xxviii"></span>When answering multiple-choice questions that you're not sure about, use a process of elimination to get rid of the obviously incorrect answers first. Doing so will improve your odds if you need to make an educated guess.</li>
            <li id="flast-li-0020">For the hands-on questions where you need to complete a task, double-check that you have finished all parts of it, including checking all tabs available to you if they give you an interface to click on. Also, understand that these questions will take longer than multiple-choice ones. Spend the time needed on them; you will be able to make up time on the shorter multiple-choice questions.</li>
            <li id="flast-li-0021">On form-based tests (nonadaptive), because the hard questions will take the most time, save them for last. You can move forward and backward through the exam.</li>
            <li id="flast-li-0022">For the latest pricing on the exams and updates to the registration procedures, visit CompTIA's website at <code><a href="http://www.comptia.org">www.comptia.org</a></code>.</li>
